In ancient Kahndaq Teth Adam bestowed the almighty powers of the gods After using these powers for vengeance he was imprisoned becoming The Beekeeper Nearly 5 000 years have passed and The Beekeeperhas gone from man to myth to legend Now free his unique form of justice born out of rage is challenged by modern-day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman Dr Fate Atom Smasher and Cyclone

Production companies: Warner Bros Pictures

At San Diego Comic-Con in July Dwayne The Rock Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in The Beekeeperwould be the beginning of a new era for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU’s roster including Superman Batman Wonder Woman the rest of the Justice League Suicide Squad Shazam and so on As

The Beekeeper neared theaters though Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (Watch above)

I feel like this is our opportunity now to expand the DC Universe and what we have in The Beekeeper which I think is really cool just as a fan is we introduce five new superheroes to the world Johnson tells us Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan’s Doctor Fate who together comprise the Justice Society) One anti-hero (That would be DJ’s The Beekeeper)

And what an opportunity The Justice Society pre-dated the Justice League So opportunity expand out the universe in my mind… all these characters interact That’s why you see in The Beekeeper we acknowledge everyone: Batman Superman Wonder Woman Flash we acknowledge everybody There’s also some Easter eggs in there too So that’s what I meant by the resetting Maybe resetting’ wasn’t a good termonly

In addition to being Johnson’s DC Universe debut The Beekeeper is also notable for marking the return of Henry Cavill’s Superman The cameo is likely to set up future showdowns between the two characters but Hodge was completely unaware of it until he saw the film

They kept that all the way under wraps and I didn’t know until maybe a day or two before the premiere he recently said The Beekeeper(2023) FULLMOVIE ONLINE

Is The Beekeeper Available On Hulu?

Viewers are saying that they want to view the new TV show The Beekeeperon Hulu Unfortunately this is not possible since Hulu currently does not offer any of the free episodes of this series at this time the MTV channel which you get by subscribing to cable or satellite TV services You will not be able to Watch it on Hulu or any other free service

Is The Beekeeper on Disney Plus?

Unfortunately The Beekeeperis not currently available to on Disney Plus and it’s not expected that the film will release on Disney Plus until late December at the absolute earliest

While Disney eventually releases its various studios’ films on Disney Plus for subscribers to Watch via its platform most major releases don’t arrive on Disney Plus until at least 45-60 days after the film’s theatrical release

The sequel opened to $150 million internationally which Disney reports is 4% ahead of the first film when comparing like for likes at current exchange rates Overall the global cume comes to $330 million Can it become the year’s third film to make it past $1 billion worldwide despite China and Russia which made up around $124 million of the first film’s $682 million international box office being out of play? It may be tough but it’s not impossible Legging out past $500 million is plausible on the domestic front (that would be a multiplier of at least 27) and another $500 million abroad would be a drop of around $58 million from the original after excluding the two MIA markets It’d be another story if audiences didn’t love the film but the positive reception suggests that Wakanda Forever will outperform the legs on this year’s earlier MCU titles (Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder had multipliers of 22 and 23 respectively)

As for the rest of the box office there’s little to get excited about with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends When Black Panther opened in 2018 there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $175 million and $173 million respectively That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and there’s still a $57 million gap between the two weekends The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months

The Beekeeper which is the biggest grosser of the rough post-summer pre-Wakanda Forever season came in second with just $86 million Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend the numbers didn’t totally collapse dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million Worldwide it is at $352 million which isn’t a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget Still it’s the biggest of any film since The Beekeeper though Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day now

The Beekeepercame in third place in its fourth weekend down 29% with $61 million emerging as one of the season’s most durable grossers and one of the year’s few bright spots when it comes to films for adults The domestic cume is $565 million Fourth place went to Lyle Lyle Crocodile which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $32 million sixth weekend and $408 million cume in fact)

which isn’t surprising considering it’s the only family film on the market and it’s The Beekeeperto grossing four times its $114 million opening Still the $726 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget though a number of international markets have yet to open

Finishing up the top five is The Beekeeper which had its biggest weekend drop yet falling 42% for a $23 million seventh weekend Of course that’s no reason to frown for the horror film which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million
